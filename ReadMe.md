# Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is that Steve is very pleased with the Stock Analysis code that we did for him because with one click he can get access to the entire dataset. Now, he wants to expand this dataset to include the entire stock market in the last few years which takes less runtime. So, we just refactored the current code to deliver the Stock Analysis with improved runtime. 


## Results

The code ran in 0.0625 seconds for the year 2017. In 2018, the code ran in 0.0640625 seconds. As you can see after refactoring the code, the code run faster in 2017. 

### Summary

* What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

Advantages of refactoring the code would be improved performance and improved quality.
Disadvantage of refactoring the code would be to understand the code which is already there and try to understand what is going on in the code. It can be little complicated to refactoring the code.

* How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

Refactoring the original VBA script was not that complicated because we just focused on one customer. It was a great learning.
